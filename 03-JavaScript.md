## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language mainly used to build interactive and dynamic web applications.

It allows developers to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle user events like clicks and form submissions, and communicate with servers using APIs.

Today, JavaScript is not limited to browsers only — it can also run on the server side using environments like Node.js.

## What is the role of the JavaScript Engine?

A JavaScript engine is responsible for executing JavaScript code.

It reads the code, parses it, converts it into machine code, and then executes it so that the browser or runtime can perform the required actions.

Different browsers have different JavaScript engines. For example, Chrome uses the V8 engine.

## How does JavaScript work internally?

Internally, the JavaScript engine first parses the code and creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Then it compiles the code into machine code using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and executes it. It also manages memory using garbage collection.
